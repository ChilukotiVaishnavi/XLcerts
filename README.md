# XLCERTS📝
The XL CERTS is a project aimed at streamlining the process of creating certificates and offer letters for students based on data provided in an Excel sheet. In academic institutions and organizations, manually generating these documents for numerous students can be time-consuming and prone to errors. XL CERTS addresses these challenges by automating the entire process, from data extraction to document generation.
